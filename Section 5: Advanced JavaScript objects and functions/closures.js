/**
 *  A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed)
 *  with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
 *  In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope
 *  from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every
 *  time a function is created, at function creation time.
